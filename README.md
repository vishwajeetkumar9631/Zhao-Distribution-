# Zhao-Distribution-
 in this set of the matlab code I have used the zhao distributio method for the analysis of the eeg signal which  is saved as schlogram image for the asu dataset which is EEG dataset fram the Arizona state university .
 the image generated from the EEG signal are given

 The **Zhao distribution**, also known as the Zhao-Atlas-Marks (ZAM) distribution, is a time-frequency representation used in signal processing. It is part of the Cohen class of distributions, which are used to analyze non-stationary signals by representing them in both time and frequency domains simultaneously. The Zhao-Atlas-Marks distribution is specifically designed to provide a clearer representation of signal components by reducing cross-terms that can occur in other time-frequency distributions like the Wigner-Ville distribution.

Time-Frequency Representation: It provides a joint time-frequency representation of signals, allowing for the analysis of their temporal and spectral characteristics simultaneously.

Reduced Cross-Terms: One of the main advantages of the Zhao-Atlas-Marks distribution is its ability to reduce cross-terms that are common in the Wigner-Ville distribution. Cross-terms can make interpretation difficult by introducing artifacts that do not correspond to actual signal components.

Adaptability: It can be adapted to highlight different aspects of the signal by tuning certain parameters, making it versatile for various applications.
